This file will hopefully help in keeping track of the 'bigger picture' of the project, and breaking down the individual components.


Block:					Each block contains 4 main pieces of information: data, previous hash, timestamp (time at creation), hash.
						The block's constructor takes it's new data, and the previous block's hash.

Blockchain:				An 'arraylist' of blocks. When a new block is created it is added to the blockchain (after mining).


Hash:					The hash is just a function taking strings to strings. 
						Hash functions are defined by being easy to compute, but very hard to 'undo', 
						i.e. we can calculate any hashes easily, but given a hash, it's near impossible to find the original input.

						The input for our hash is the string concatenation of all the relevant data: previous hash, timestamp, data.

IsChainValid():			A method to check the blockchain has not been tampered with, 
						i.e. loops through the blockchain from the beginning and checks if the hashes match
						(costly process as the blockchain grows???)		


Mining:					A block is created, but then must be 'mined' before being added to the blockchain. 
						This is done by searching for the value (nonce) that when included in the hash,
						gives a hash with a certain number of zeroes at the start.

						The idea is that 'work' has to be done to create a block, giving an incentive to 'miners'.


Wallet:					Has a private key (used to verify identity) and public key (our 'address').
						Private and public keys are generated together (Elliptic Curves!).
